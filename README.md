# LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode Journey repository! This repository documents my solutions to LeetCode problems, along with reflections on my thought process, approach, and comparisons with optimized solutions. Each problem includes my solution, the official or more optimized LeetCode solution (where applicable), and a README explaining how I approached the problem.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to track my progress in solving LeetCode problems, improve my problem-solving skills, and learn from more efficient solutions. By including both my initial solutions and optimized ones, I aim to reflect on my coding journey, understand where I can optimize my approaches, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure
For each LeetCode problem, I include:
- **My Solution**: My initial code to solve the problem, written in Java.
- **LeetCode/Optimized Solution**: A more efficient or official solution (if applicable) to compare with my approach.
- **README**: A detailed explanation of my intuition, approach, time and space complexity, and reflections on how my solution compares to the optimized one.

The problems are organized by their LeetCode problem number and title. For example:

/Problem_594_Longest_Harmonious_Subsequence
MySolution.java
README.md /Problem_1480_Running_Sum_of_1D_Array
MySolution.java
README.md /Problem_1672_Richest_Customer_Wealth
MySolution.java
README.md


## Problems Solved
Below is a list of problems included in this repository (to be updated as I add more solutions):
- **[594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](Problem_594_Longest_Harmonious_Subsequence/README.md)**: Finding the longest subsequence where the difference between max and min elements is exactly 1.
- **[1480. Running Sum of 1D Array](Problem_1480_Running_Sum_of_1D_Array/README.md)**: Computing the running sum of elements in a 1D array.
- **[1672. Richest Customer Wealth](Problem_1672_Richest_Customer_Wealth/README.md)**: Finding the maximum wealth of a customer from a 2D array of bank accounts.

## My Approach
For each problem, I follow this process:
1. **Intuition**: I jot down my initial thoughts on how to solve the problem, focusing on understanding the requirements and constraints.
2. **Implementation**: I write a solution based on my intuition, typically prioritizing correctness over optimization.
3. **Analysis**: I calculate the time and space complexity of my solution and document it in the README.
4. **Comparison**: I compare my solution with the official or optimized LeetCode solution to identify areas for improvement, such as reducing time complexity or space usage.
5. **Reflection**: I note what I learned from the problem and how I can apply those lessons to future problems.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Tools**: Any standard Java IDE or text editor for coding, Git for version control, and GitHub for hosting the repository.
- **Documentation**: Markdown for writing README files in GitHub-flavored Markdown format.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Browse the problem folders to find the specific LeetCode problem you're interested in.
2. Read the `README.md` in each problem folder for a detailed explanation of my thought process and approach.
3. Check `MySolution.java` for my initial implementation.
4. Compare with the optimized solution (if provided) in the README or separate file to understand differences in efficiency.
5. Feel free to fork this repository or suggest improvements via issues or pull requests!

## Goals
- Solve at least one LeetCode problem per week to build consistency.
- Improve my understanding of algorithmic concepts like arrays, dynamic programming, and two-pointer techniques.
- Optimize my solutions by learning from official solutions and community discussions.
- Document my learning process to reinforce concepts and share knowledge.

## Contributing
This is a personal project to track my learning journey, but I welcome feedback! If you have suggestions for improving my solutions, optimizing code, or better ways to document my process, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
